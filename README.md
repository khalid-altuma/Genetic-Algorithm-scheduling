# Genetic-Algorithm-scheduling
Power Plant Scheduling using Genetic Algorithm
This repository contains a Python script that uses a genetic algorithm to schedule maintenance for a power plant with multiple units. The goal of the script is to find the optimal maintenance schedule that maximizes the power plant's capacity while adhering to the maintenance constraints.

The script prompts the user for the following inputs:

Number of units in the power plant
Capacity and intervals required for maintenance of each unit
Maximum load for each interval
Based on the inputs, the script generates a gene pool of possible maintenance schedules and evolves the pool over multiple generations to find the optimal schedule. The script outputs the initial and final gene pools, providing a visual representation of the schedule.

This script can be useful for power plant operators who want to optimize their maintenance schedules to increase power generation and reduce costs.

Getting Started
To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Clone this repository and open the genetic-algorithm-power-plant-scheduling.py file in an editor or IDE of your choice.

You can execute the script on a online python terminal like online-python.com.

Follow the prompts and enter the required inputs. The script will output the initial and final gene pools, providing a visual representation of the schedule.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific needs.
